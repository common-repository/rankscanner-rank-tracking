= Monitor your Google positions automatically =

RankScanner will automatically crawl your rankings on Google, and report back to you with updates and changes in your search engine positions, to let you know if you blog has improved or dropped on a weekly basis. All positions will be checked either every day, week or month depending on which plan you have selected for your blog's domain.

It has become increasingly important to keep track of your SERPs on Google, as organic search traffic accounts for a significant part of most blog's website traffic. This rank tracker makes things much easier, as rankings will be checked automatically by RankScanner's engine and you can therefore sit back and enjoy beautiful statistics and reports without lifting a finger, as you will be kept up to date on your rankings on Google.

= Mobile Rankings vs Desktop SERPs =

If you are curious about which SERP positions your website has on mobile phones, look no further - With a simple click you can switch the view from desktop to mobile, and compare the rankings between the two different platforms. It's an extremely easy way to keep track of both, and start working on improving the mobile positions along with the usual search engine optimisation for your website. And the best part is, that everything happens entirely automatically.

= Track keywords for free =

Any RankScanner user - with an interest in SEO - will be able to track their performance on Google without having to pay a dime, as RankScanner's entry plan is completely free to use and gives you up to 30 keywords and monthly rank checks - everything is still automatic, and this is by far the most popular plan for most WordPress bloggers, as they will still be able to enjoy email alerts and tracking data (such as graphs and historical rankings), when they drop or improve keyword positions on Google's search engine ranking pages.

4. The average chart gives you a nice idea of how your blog has performed in Google over time.

5. You can trust RankScanner to keep you updated when keywords have been checked and when there is a significant event, such as a sudden boost or drop in your average SEO rankings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often does RankScanner check the rankings of my keywords? =

At least every month. However, RankScanner has a smart queue system that checks some keywords more frequently than others depending on how stabile the individual keyword positions are. Should you want more keywords tracked for your domain and for your keywords to be checked more frequently, there are 30-day trials on all paid plans which will each extend the functionality of all features, as well as allow you to see all SEO recommendations, fixes, errors and warnings in the 'RankScanner: SEO Audit' plugin.

= Is it possible to monitor more keywords? =

Definitely. Just refer some friends or colleagues, or simply upgrade your domain to one of the extra plans.
